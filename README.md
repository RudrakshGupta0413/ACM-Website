# ACM-Website

First go through the complete codebase, understnd it and then try to implement your ideas.
Each of u should maintain an individual branch of your own names or u can do one more thing, make branches according to thefeatures/fixes/etc.
Currently the wesbite is hosted on my vercel account and its not working because of some issues in the codebase, find it and resolve it and after that if needed deploy the project on your own vercel account 3rd years will look into this.
Also try to make the complete project in one stack (MERN or use Next.js).
If any issue comes up first try to resolve it on your own take help from your 3rd yrs and if still the issue is not resolved, then open an issue in the repo only i will look into, but first try to resolve it by yourself.
